## Project - Deliverable \# 1 Feedback 

I think this is a great project! My concern is whether you will have access to the necessary data you will need to implement your analysis portion. It can sometimes be difficult to grab data from various countries; therefore, before you get too deep, make sure that you have access to all the necessary data required to complete the analysis.  

Questions 
--------

Do we need to necessarily use Python or can we use a hybrid model where we do data analysis, data pulling and injection into the database using Python and build the viz tool in a non-pythonic framework like R Shiny?

Yes, you don't need to fully use Python. You can use a hybrid model to help build the overall tool. Keep in mind it must be easy for me to run and interact with the tool so keep that in mind because that is a significant portion of your grade.
